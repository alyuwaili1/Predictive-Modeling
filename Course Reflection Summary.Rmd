# Week 1

1. **Data Science Process**: Learned about the various stages involved in a data science project, from understanding the business problem to evaluating and deploying the model.
2. **Loading Data in R**: Explored different ways to load data into R, including CSV, Excel, and using APIs.

# Week 2

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Learned the importance of exploring data using summary statistics and visualizations to gain initial insights.
2. **Data Management**: Understood how to handle missing values and perform data transformations to prepare for modeling.

# Week 3

1. **Linear Regression Assumptions**: Studied the assumptions behind linear regression models, such as linearity, homoscedasticity, and independence.
2. **Building Linear Regression Models**: Practiced building linear regression models and making predictions using R.

# Week 4

1. **Logistic Regression**: Learned about logistic regression for binary classification problems, including how to interpret model coefficients.
2. **Performance Measures**: Understood key performance measures like precision, recall, and accuracy for classification models.

# Week 5

1. **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**: Learned about GLMs, including Poisson and Gamma regression, which extend linear models to non-normal distributions.
2. **Use Cases for GLMs**: Discussed different business scenarios where GLMs are useful, such as predicting counts or rates.

# Week 6

1. **Decision Trees**: Learned how to build decision trees for classification and regression, and understood the concept of tree pruning.
2. **Random Forest and GBM**: Studied ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to improve model performance.

# Week 7

1. **Cluster Analysis**: Learned about clustering techniques, including k-means, to segment data into similar groups.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Studied PCA as a dimensionality reduction technique to simplify complex datasets.

# Week 8

1. **Documentation and Deployment**: Learned the importance of documenting code and results clearly, and the basics of deploying models to production.
2. **Communication**: Focused on how to effectively communicate modeling results to different audiences, including technical and non-technical stakeholders.
